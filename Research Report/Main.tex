\section{Introduction}
Virtual reality (VR) has become a powerful tool for immersive interaction, yet the prevalent use of handheld controllers create barriers for individuals with limited hand mobility. Traditional interfaces that depend on manual input are not well suited for users who cannot effectively manipulate these devices, thereby excluding potential users from fully engaging with VR experiences. In order to bridge this gap, this work proposes establishing a system that integrates voice commands with head-tracking in order to select objects and move around in virtual environments.  By facilitating hands-free operation, the system aims not only to improve usability but also to empower users with motor impairments to experience VR in a more natural and inclusive way. Ultimately, this research seeks to contribute to a more accessible design ensuring that immersive technologies are available to all users regardless of their physical capabilities 

\section{Related Work}
Since the inception of VR, natural language interaction has long been at the forefront of proposed interfaces. Though, historically underutilized compared to gaze or gesture controls\cite{a1}. Prior research typically only supported simple spoken commands or short phrases combined with pointing gestures to select objects in VR. Recent research, however, has shown the effectiveness of purely speech-driven controls for scenarios where the subjects hands are busy, like in a sterile medical setting \cite{a2}. Despite these advancements,  voice input has often only been included when necessary, rather than being a standard interaction method or systematically evaluated on performance and user preference across all VR applications \cite{a1}.

\subsection{Usability}
Evaluations of voice input in VR suggest this it has the potential to add to the user's experience  \cite{a3} and serve as an effective interaction method. When voice control navigation, while in a wheelchair within virtual environments, is compared to traditional input modalities, it was revealed that participants travel longer distances but also had a higher collision rate \cite{a3}. However, combining voice control with autonomous systems enables a higher degree of interaction and control, which positively impact quality of life, efficiency, and safety \cite{a3}. Similarly, participants who were assessed on their perception of voice control across orientation, customization, and analysis tasks, also rated usability high and provided positive feedback on factors such as sickness, comfort, and presence, with an overall accuracy of 85 percent. These outcomes support the conclusion that voice is a feasible input modality for VR environments \cite{a2}.

\subsection{Accessibility}

Despite the rapid evolustion of VR technology, accessibility remains an afterthought in most virtual environments. With over one hundred locomotion techniques available, few research efforts have explored their benefits for users with mobility impairments\cite{a4}. A 2024 review of 330 popular VR applications reported a general lack of accessibility features in current VR content \cite{a5}. Many did not even include options like audio cues or haptic feedback to convey information that would help user with limited vision or mobility.  Alternative input methods are still rare in most commercial VR titles\cite{a5}. This trend has not gone unnoticed, though, accessibility experts have begun publishing guidelines geared towards immersion. For instance, the University of South Carolina's Center for Teaching Excellence acknowledges the accessibility challenges that users face and have set guidelines that are designed to explain the accessibility issues with virtual environments and provide practical solutions \cite{b1}. Similarly, industry articles emphasize providing choices like seated play modes, adjustable movement speeds, and customization button mappings to accommodate those with limited motor function \cite{a6}. Flexibility and choice are the cornerstone principles for accessible VR interaction and require broader reviews. By combining insights from these studies, developers and researchers can move closer to VR that is inclusive for all.

 \section{Methodology}
This study is designed as a pilot experiment to explore the feasibility of implementing voice control within a virtual reality environments. Using an Oculus Quest 3 headset coupled with the Vosk voice interface, the system enables hands-free navigation and object selection within a simple living room VR environment on Unity. 
 
 \subsection{Sample}
The participants consists of a convenience sample that include my partner, their mother, and my two children. Although the sample does not represent a broad unbiased population, it provides initial insights into the usability of the voice-controlled VR interface within different age groups.  

% The primary parameter given to the ``\verb|acmart|'' document class is
% the {\itshape template style} which corresponds to the kind of publication
% or SIG publishing the work. This parameter is enclosed in square
% brackets and is a part of the {\verb|documentclass|} command:
% \begin{verbatim}
%   \documentclass[STYLE]{acmart}
% \end{verbatim}
\subsection{Apparatus}
The primary hardware component of this study is the Oculus Quest 3. This system is an all-in-one VR headset developed by Meta. It features a high-resolution display with a per-eye resolution of approximately 2064 x 2208 pixels and a wide field of view. The headset comes equipped with inside-out tracking via integrated cameras, allowing for precise head tracking. Additionally, the Oculus Quest 3 is equipped with a built-in microphone for voice command input. 

% The experimental setup consists of:
% \begin{itemize}
% \item {\texttt{Hardware}}: An Oculus Quest 3 headset to deliver the VR experience.
% \item {\texttt{Software}}: Unity - with VR environment. and Vosk voice interface is integrateed into the Unity project to interpret commands such as "forwad", "select", and "stop." 
% \end{itemize}


\subsection{Independent Variable}
The independent variable is the implementation of  voice commands through the Vosk voice interface, which is integrated into the Unity VR environment. This  consists of commands like "forward", "back", "stop" and  "select" that the participants use to navigate and interact within the virtual space.

\subsection{Dependent Variables}
The dependent variables were the performance and user experience outcomes of the system:
\begin{itemize}
\item {\texttt{Task Completion Time}}: The quantitative measurement in seconds, this records how long it takes participants to navigate to destination and how long it takes for them to interact with the virtual button. 
\item {\texttt{Error Rate}}: A quantitative measurement that tracks the number of missed voice commands
\item {\texttt{User Feedback}}: A qualitative measurement collected upon completion of the tasks, includes ratings on ease-of-use, satisfaction, and overall experience with the voice controlled VR system.  
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Design And Procedure}
\begin{itemize}
\item {\texttt{Introduction And Briefing}}: The participants were given a brief overview of the study's purpose. They were instructed on how to wear the Oculus Quest 3 and provided with a short demonstration explaining how head movements coupled with voice commands allow for navigation and interaction.
\item {\texttt{Experimental Task}}: Participants started at a predefined location within the virtual living room. They were instructed to navigate to a designated area using head movement, to orient direction, while speaking the command "forward". Upon reaching the designated area where two buttons are located, participants were required to use head movement to point to a specified button and speak the command "select". To ensure reliability, each participant completed multiple trials of the navigation and interaction tasks.
\item {\texttt{Data Analysis}}: The dependent variables were collected manually by the researcher, error amount during each task and time to complete each task. After completion of the trials, user feedback was asked via survey consisting of ease-of-use, satisfaction, and overall experience with the voice controlled VR system.  
\end{itemize}


% \section{Typefaces}

% The ``\verb|acmart|'' document class requires the use of the
% ``Libertine'' typeface family. Your \TeX\ installation should include
% this set of packages. Please do not substitute other typefaces. The
% ``\verb|lmodern|'' and ``\verb|ltimes|'' packages should not be used,
% as they will override the built-in typeface families.

% \section{Title Information}

% The title of your work should use capital letters appropriately -
% \url{https://capitalizemytitle.com/} has useful rules for
% capitalization. Use the {\verb|title|} command to define the title of
% your work. If your work has a subtitle, define it with the
% {\verb|subtitle|} command.  Do not insert line breaks in your title.

% If your title is lengthy, you must define a short version to be used
% in the page headers, to prevent overlapping text. The \verb|title|
% command has a ``short title'' parameter:
% \begin{verbatim}
%   \title[short title]{full title}
% \end{verbatim}

% \section{Authors and Affiliations}

% Each author must be defined separately for accurate metadata
% identification.  As an exception, multiple authors may share one
% affiliation. Authors' names should not be abbreviated; use full first
% names wherever possible. Include authors' e-mail addresses whenever
% possible.

% Grouping authors' names or e-mail addresses, or providing an ``e-mail
% alias,'' as shown below, is not acceptable:
% \begin{verbatim}
%   \author{Brooke Aster, David Mehldau}
%   \email{dave,judy,steve@university.edu}
%   \email{firstname.lastname@phillips.org}
% \end{verbatim}

% The \verb|authornote| and \verb|authornotemark| commands allow a note
% to apply to multiple authors --- for example, if the first two authors
% of an article contributed equally to the work.

% If your author list is lengthy, you must define a shortened version of
% the list of authors to be used in the page headers, to prevent
% overlapping text. The following command should be placed just after
% the last \verb|\author{}| definition:
% \begin{verbatim}
%   \renewcommand{\shortauthors}{McCartney, et al.}
% \end{verbatim}
% Omitting this command will force the use of a concatenated list of all
% of the authors' names, which may result in overlapping text in the
% page headers.

% The article template's documentation, available at
% \url{https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template}, has a
% complete explanation of these commands and tips for their effective
% use.

% Note that authors' addresses are mandatory for journal articles.

% \section{Rights Information}

% Authors of any work published by ACM will need to complete a rights
% form. Depending on the kind of work, and the rights management choice
% made by the author, this may be copyright transfer, permission,
% license, or an OA (open access) agreement.

% Regardless of the rights management choice, the author will receive a
% copy of the completed rights form once it has been submitted. This
% form contains \LaTeX\ commands that must be copied into the source
% document. When the document source is compiled, these commands and
% their parameters add formatted text to several areas of the final
% document:
% \begin{itemize}
% \item the ``ACM Reference Format'' text on the first page.
% \item the ``rights management'' text on the first page.
% \item the conference information in the page header(s).
% \end{itemize}

% Rights information is unique to the work; if you are preparing several
% works for an event, make sure to use the correct set of commands with
% each of the works.

% The ACM Reference Format text is required for all articles over one
% page in length, and is optional for one-page articles (abstracts).

% \section{CCS Concepts and User-Defined Keywords}

% Two elements of the ``acmart'' document class provide powerful
% taxonomic tools for you to help readers find your work in an online
% search.

% The ACM Computing Classification System ---
% \url{https://www.acm.org/publications/class-2012} --- is a set of
% classifiers and concepts that describe the computing
% discipline. Authors can select entries from this classification
% system, via \url{https://dl.acm.org/ccs/ccs.cfm}, and generate the
% commands to be included in the \LaTeX\ source.

% User-defined keywords are a comma-separated list of words and phrases
% of the authors' choosing, providing a more flexible way of describing
% the research being presented.

% CCS concepts and user-defined keywords are required for for all
% articles over two pages in length, and are optional for one- and
% two-page articles (or abstracts).

% \section{Sectioning Commands}

% Your work should use standard \LaTeX\ sectioning commands:
% \verb|\section|, \verb|\subsection|, \verb|\subsubsection|,
% \verb|\paragraph|, and \verb|\subparagraph|. The sectioning levels up to
% \verb|\subsusection| should be numbered; do not remove the numbering
% from the commands.

% Simulating a sectioning command by setting the first word or words of
% a paragraph in boldface or italicized text is {\bfseries not allowed.}

% Below are examples of sectioning commands.

% \subsection{Subsection}
% \label{sec:subsection}

% This is a subsection.

% \subsubsection{Subsubsection}
% \label{sec:subsubsection}

% This is a subsubsection.

% \paragraph{Paragraph}

% This is a paragraph.

% \subparagraph{Subparagraph}

% This is a subparagraph.

% \section{Tables}

% The ``\verb|acmart|'' document class includes the ``\verb|booktabs|''
% package --- \url{https://ctan.org/pkg/booktabs} --- for preparing
% high-quality tables.

% Table captions are placed {\itshape above} the table.

% Because tables cannot be split across pages, the best placement for
% them is typically the top of the page nearest their initial cite.  To
% ensure this proper ``floating'' placement of tables, use the
% environment \textbf{table} to enclose the table's contents and the
% table caption.  The contents of the table itself must go in the
% \textbf{tabular} environment, to be aligned properly in rows and
% columns, with the desired horizontal and vertical rules.  Again,
% detailed instructions on \textbf{tabular} material are found in the
% \textit{\LaTeX\ User's Guide}.

% Immediately following this sentence is the point at which
% Table~\ref{tab:freq} is included in the input file; compare the
% placement of the table here with the table in the printed output of
% this document.

% \begin{table}
%   \caption{Frequency of Special Characters}
%   \label{tab:freq}
%   \begin{tabular}{ccl}
%     \toprule
%     Non-English or Math&Frequency&Comments\\
%     \midrule
%     \O & 1 in 1,000& For Swedish names\\
%     $\pi$ & 1 in 5& Common in math\\
%     \$ & 4 in 5 & Used in business\\
%     $\Psi^2_1$ & 1 in 40,000& Unexplained usage\\
%   \bottomrule
% \end{tabular}
% \end{table}

% To set a wider table, which takes up the whole width of the page's
% live area, use the environment \textbf{table*} to enclose the table's
% contents and the table caption.  As with a single-column table, this
% wide table will ``float'' to a location deemed more
% desirable. Immediately following this sentence is the point at which
% Table~\ref{tab:commands} is included in the input file; again, it is
% instructive to compare the placement of the table here with the table
% in the printed output of this document.

% \begin{table*}
%   \caption{Some Typical Commands}
%   \label{tab:commands}
%   \begin{tabular}{ccl}
%     \toprule
%     Command &A Number & Comments\\
%     \midrule
%     \texttt{{\char'134}author} & 100& Author \\
%     \texttt{{\char'134}table}& 300 & For tables\\
%     \texttt{{\char'134}table*}& 400& For wider tables\\
%     \bottomrule
%   \end{tabular}
% \end{table*}

% Always use midrule to separate table header rows from data rows, and
% use it only for this purpose. This enables assistive technologies to
% recognise table headers and support their users in navigating tables
% more easily.

% \section{Math Equations}
% You may want to display math equations in three distinct styles:
% inline, numbered or non-numbered display.  Each of the three are
% discussed in the next sections.

% \subsection{Inline (In-text) Equations}
% A formula that appears in the running text is called an inline or
% in-text formula.  It is produced by the \textbf{math} environment,
% which can be invoked with the usual
% \texttt{{\char'134}begin\,\ldots{\char'134}end} construction or with
% the short form \texttt{\$\,\ldots\$}. You can use any of the symbols
% and structures, from $\alpha$ to $\omega$, available in
% \LaTeX~\cite{Lamport:LaTeX}; this section will simply show a few
% examples of in-text equations in context. Notice how this equation:
% \begin{math}
%   \lim_{n\rightarrow \infty}x=0
% \end{math},
% set here in in-line math style, looks slightly different when
% set in display style.  (See next section).

% \subsection{Display Equations}
% A numbered display equation---one set off by vertical space from the
% text and centered horizontally---is produced by the \textbf{equation}
% environment. An unnumbered display equation is produced by the
% \textbf{displaymath} environment.

% Again, in either environment, you can use any of the symbols and
% structures available in \LaTeX\@; this section will just give a couple
% of examples of display equations in context.  First, consider the
% equation, shown as an inline equation above:
% \begin{equation}
%   \lim_{n\rightarrow \infty}x=0
% \end{equation}
% Notice how it is formatted somewhat differently in
% the \textbf{displaymath}
% environment.  Now, we'll enter an unnumbered equation:
% \begin{displaymath}
%   \sum_{i=0}^{\infty} x + 1
% \end{displaymath}
% and follow it with another numbered equation:
% \begin{equation}
%   \sum_{i=0}^{\infty}x_i=\int_{0}^{\pi+2} f
% \end{equation}
% just to demonstrate \LaTeX's able handling of numbering.

% \section{Figures}

% The ``\verb|figure|'' environment should be used for figures. One or
% more images can be placed within a figure. If your figure contains
% third-party material, you must clearly identify it as such, as shown
% in the example below.
% \begin{figure}[h]
%   \centering
%   \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{sample-franklin}
%   \caption{1907 Franklin Model D roadster. Photograph by Harris \&
%     Ewing, Inc. [Public domain], via Wikimedia
%     Commons. (\url{https://goo.gl/VLCRBB}).}
%   \Description{A woman and a girl in white dresses sit in an open car.}
% \end{figure}

% Your figures should contain a caption which describes the figure to
% the reader.

% Figure captions are placed {\itshape below} the figure.

% Every figure should also have a figure description unless it is purely
% decorative. These descriptions convey what’s in the image to someone
% who cannot see it. They are also used by search engine crawlers for
% indexing images, and when images cannot be loaded.

% A figure description must be unformatted plain text less than 2000
% characters long (including spaces).  {\bfseries Figure descriptions
%   should not repeat the figure caption – their purpose is to capture
%   important information that is not already provided in the caption or
%   the main text of the paper.} For figures that convey important and
% complex new information, a short text description may not be
% adequate. More complex alternative descriptions can be placed in an
% appendix and referenced in a short figure description. For example,
% provide a data table capturing the information in a bar chart, or a
% structured list representing a graph.  For additional information
% regarding how best to write figure descriptions and why doing this is
% so important, please see
% \url{https://www.acm.org/publications/taps/describing-figures/}.

% \subsection{The ``Teaser Figure''}

% A ``teaser figure'' is an image, or set of images in one figure, that
% are placed after all author and affiliation information, and before
% the body of the article, spanning the page. If you wish to have such a
% figure in your article, place the command immediately before the
% \verb|\maketitle| command:
% \begin{verbatim}
%   \begin{teaserfigure}
%     \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{sampleteaser}
%     \caption{figure caption}
%     \Description{figure description}
%   \end{teaserfigure}
% \end{verbatim}

% \section{Citations and Bibliographies}

% The use of \BibTeX\ for the preparation and formatting of one's
% references is strongly recommended. Authors' names should be complete
% --- use full first names (``Donald E. Knuth'') not initials
% (``D. E. Knuth'') --- and the salient identifying features of a
% reference should be included: title, year, volume, number, pages,
% article DOI, etc.

% The bibliography is included in your source document with these two
% commands, placed just before the \verb|\end{document}| command:
% \begin{verbatim}
%   \bibliographystyle{ACM-Reference-Format}
%   \bibliography{bibfile}
% \end{verbatim}
% where ``\verb|bibfile|'' is the name, without the ``\verb|.bib|''
% suffix, of the \BibTeX\ file.

% Citations and references are numbered by default. A small number of
% ACM publications have citations and references formatted in the
% ``author year'' style; for these exceptions, please include this
% command in the {\bfseries preamble} (before the command
% ``\verb|\begin{document}|'') of your \LaTeX\ source:
% \begin{verbatim}
%   \citestyle{acmauthoryear}
% \end{verbatim}


%   Some examples.  A paginated journal article \cite{Abril07}, an
%   enumerated journal article \cite{Cohen07}, a reference to an entire
%   issue \cite{JCohen96}, a monograph (whole book) \cite{Kosiur01}, a
%   monograph/whole book in a series (see 2a in spec. document)
%   \cite{Harel79}, a divisible-book such as an anthology or compilation
%   \cite{Editor00} followed by the same example, however we only output
%   the series if the volume number is given \cite{Editor00a} (so

% and subsection identification method.

% \section{Multi-language papers}

% Papers may be written in languages other than English or include
% titles, subtitles, keywords and abstracts in different languages (as a
% rule, a paper in a language other than English should include an
% English title and an English abstract).  Use \verb|language=...| for
% every language used in the paper.  The last language indicated is the
% main language of the paper.  For example, a French paper with
% additional titles and abstracts in English and German may start with
% the following command
% \begin{verbatim}
% \documentclass[sigconf, language=english, language=german,
%                language=french]{acmart}
% \end{verbatim}

% The title, subtitle, keywords and abstract will be typeset in the main
% language of the paper.  The commands \verb|\translatedXXX|, \verb|XXX|
% begin title, subtitle and keywords, can be used to set these elements
% in the other languages.  The environment \verb|translatedabstract| is
% used to set the translation of the abstract.  These commands and
% environment have a mandatory first argument: the language of the
% second argument.  See \verb|sample-sigconf-i13n.tex| file for examples
% of their usage.

% \section{SIGCHI Extended Abstracts}

% The ``\verb|sigchi-a|'' template style (available only in \LaTeX\ and
% not in Word) produces a landscape-orientation formatted article, with
% a wide left margin. Three environments are available for use with the
% ``\verb|sigchi-a|'' template style, and produce formatted output in
% the margin:
% \begin{description}
% \item[\texttt{sidebar}:]  Place formatted text in the margin.
% \item[\texttt{marginfigure}:] Place a figure in the margin.
% \item[\texttt{margintable}:] Place a table in the margin.
% \end{description}

% %%
% %% The acknowledgments section is defined using the "acks" environment
% %% (and NOT an unnumbered section). This ensures the proper
% %% identification of the section in the article metadata, and the
% %% consistent spelling of the heading.
% \begin{acks}
% To Robert, for the bagels and explaining CMYK and color spaces.
% \end{acks}

% %
% The next two lines define the bibliography style to be used, and
% the bibliography file.
